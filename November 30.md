# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

Did user testing and preliminary evaluation, so less to report on this week, as most of that
can be found in the critique feedback and the evalation document. Beyond that, it was thanksgiving
break so I did not work on the project as much. Feel free to download the project and open it in XCode! It should
be pretty easy to do on a Mac, and probably close to impossible on PC. Anyways, more user feedback can be nice, but 
probably read critique feedback and preliminary evaluation before then for feedback already given.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I need to implement the changes from the user feedback. With this, I do not have as many design 
decisions I need to make, mostly just coding the changes as I do agree that they are important.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Maybe try out the language in its current state, keeping in mind the changes I already plan to make. Are
there are aspects you would like me to focus on to see come to fruition by the end of the semester? I would
like to know what features would be cool to have as the next iteration prototype.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

1.25 hours on UX feedback

1.5 hours on critique

1.25 hours on brand/name design and brainstorming

1 hour on critique feedback, preliminary evaluation and notebook.

THANKSGIVING BREAK

## Post-critique summary

My prototype so far is good progress. There are a couple of concerns with regards to 
the intuitive-ness of the language. The first is the speed, and the second
is number of repeats. Paul found that it would be most important to add
the feature for changing speed first. The ability to combine animations 
is good, and the way a path is expressed is overall pretty good, but 
following a disjoint path is unintuitive. The image locations used were
confusing, and it would be best to be able to choose some images from some
staging area.

## Post-critique reflection

Thank you Paul for your feedback! I definitely plan on implementing the sliders
next now as I do agree that is important to actually have good control over
the animations. Also, I agree on the disjoint path aspect, as that is something
that the users for the UX testing found odd as well. Those are two aspects I
will focus on changing next. In terms of the image bank idea, I plan to allow
users to actually draw after I finish those other two features, so the images
will no longer be used. If I find that harder to implement, I may just go with 
your idea.

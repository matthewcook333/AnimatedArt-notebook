# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

1.25 hours on UX feedback

1.5 hours on critique

1.25 hours on brand/name design and brainstorming

## Post-critique summary

My prototype so far is good progress. There are a couple of concerns with regards to 
the intuitive-ness of the language. The first is the speed, and the second
is number of repeats. Paul found that it would be most important to add
the feature for changing speed first. The ability to combine animations 
is good, and the way a path is expressed is overall pretty good, but 
following a disjoint path is unintuitive. The image locations used were
confusing, and it would be best to be able to choose some images from some
staging area.

## Post-critique reflection

Thank you Paul for your feedback! I definitely plan on implementing the sliders
next now as I do agree that is important to actually have good control over
the animations. Also, I agree on the disjoint path aspect, as that is something
that the users for the UX testing found odd as well. Those are two aspects I
will focus on changing next. In terms of the image bank idea, I plan to allow
users to actually draw after I finish those other two features, so the images
will no longer be used. If I find that harder to implement, I may just go with 
your idea.

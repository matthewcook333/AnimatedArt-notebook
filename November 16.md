# Design notebook for week ending November 16, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

## Post-critique summary

Overall, I am making good progress and it was good to be familiar with the tools and how Swift works. Professor Ben made a good point to use the tool that will most fit my IR for choosing between CoreAnimation and SpriteKit. Especially because my language is not text based, I need to make sure that I am very careful and specific in describing what my language will actually look like, and what is to be expected for a user to use the DSL. I should have an outline of how the interactions and interface will look, and really go into more detail on how that will occur. 

I have outlined the overall process, but I need to detail the specific things that occur at each step in the process. The high level design of my DSL makes sense, but these smaller details are what I need to focus on to really flesh out the DSL and allow me to implement it.

## Post-critique reflection

I definitely agree with everything Mauricio has mentioned, as I myself have not really fleshed out the details (I kinda thought about each thing disjointedly, but not how everything ought to work together). I have also decided to go with SpriteKit for now as I think that really does work better as a close representation to the IR, although that decision may change as I really dive into the implementation.

As a response to the critique, I have actually wrote out exactly what the interface will look like, and how the user can create something within this DSL. This will be a part of my stuff this week! Thank you Mauricio!

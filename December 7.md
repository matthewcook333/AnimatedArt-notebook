# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

***12/1***

Started working on the project this week by implementing speed sliders. I now have a rotation speed slider working, although there are changes I would like to make to it as right now it resets the position every time the slider changes, and I would rather it just update the old animation that existed. To do so cleanly may require some refactoring of the code.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

1.25 hours on critique

1 hour working on speed sliders
